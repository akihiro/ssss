 * This is an implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. See
 * the project's homepage http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/ for more
 * information on this topic.
 *
 * This code links against the GNU multiprecision library "libgmp".
 * Original author compiled the code successfully with gmp 4.1.4.
 * Jon Frisby compiled the code successfully with gmp 5.0.2.
 *
 * You will need a system that has a /dev/random entropy source.
 *
 * Compile with
 * "gcc -O2 -lgmp -o ssss-split ssss.c && ln ssss-split ssss-combine"
 *
 * Compile with -DNOMLOCK to obtain a version without memory locking.
 *
 * If you encounter compile issues, compile with USE_RESTORE_SECRET_WORKAROUND.
