 *
 * You will need a system that has a /dev/random entropy source.
 *
 * Compile with
 * "gcc -O2 -lgmp -o ssss-split ssss.c && ln ssss-split ssss-combine"
 *
 * Compile with -DNOMLOCK to obtain a version without memory locking.
 *
 * If you encounter compile issues, compile with USE_RESTORE_SECRET_WORKAROUND.
